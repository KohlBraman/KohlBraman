### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kohl Braman, and I'm a new software developer! I am currently working on my prework for Tech Elevator which starts in october. I'm currently learning how to use Git and GitHub. I am looking to collaborate on any project especially pertaining to loops which I struggle the most with. Ask me about my cat or my tortoise! you can reach me by email at kohlbraman@gmail.com. My pronouns are He/Him. A fun fact about me is I was in the U.S. Navy as a aircraft mechanic for safety equipment but before that I was a bomb builder on the USS Dwight D Eisenhower!
